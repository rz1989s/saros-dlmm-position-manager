## 🐛 Known Issues

### Critical Issues
- ✅ **TAB SWITCHING FAILURE** - RESOLVED (discovered and fixed 2025-10-01)
  - **Severity**: CRITICAL
  - **Affected Pages**: All 4 Phase 1 pages (Portfolio, Risk, Migration, Fees)
  - **Impact**: Users cannot switch tabs, 83% of page content inaccessible
  - **Symptoms**: Tabs receive focus but content panels don't switch, React state doesn't update
  - **Root Cause**: Controlled tabs pattern (`value={state} onValueChange={setState}`) incompatible with setup
  - **Solution**: Convert to uncontrolled tabs pattern (`defaultValue="initial"`)
  - **Status**: ✅ FIXED AND VERIFIED
  - **Resolution Time**: ~1 hour
  - **Testing**: All 4 pages verified working with live browser testing
  - **Details**: See `docs/CRITICAL_BUG_REPORT.md` for complete resolution

### Minor Issues
- ⚠️ Multiple 404 errors for Next.js static chunks (development environment only, not affecting functionality)
- ⚠️ "Invalid or unexpected token" JavaScript error in console (development environment only)

### Future Enhancements
1. Add unit tests for financial calculations
2. Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
3. Add error tracking (Sentry/similar)
4. Optimize initial bundle load time
5. Add progressive loading for large datasets

---

## 📈 Performance Optimization Opportunities

### Already Optimized
- ✅ Code splitting by route
- ✅ Component lazy loading
- ✅ React memoization (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- ✅ Efficient re-rendering
- ✅ Skeleton loading states

### Future Optimizations
1. **Image Optimization**: Add next/image for any images
2. **Font Optimization**: Preload critical fonts
3. **Prefetching**: Add prefetch for common navigation paths
4. **Service Worker**: Implement PWA caching strategies
5. **Data Pagination**: For large position lists
