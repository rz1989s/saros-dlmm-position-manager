## DLMM Technology Deep Dive

### What is DLMM?
Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM) is an advanced AMM protocol that discretizes liquidity into price bins, offering:

- **Zero Slippage Within Bins:** Each bin represents a single price point with constant exchange rates
- **Dynamic Fees:** Fees increase during high volatility when active bins change
- **Capital Efficiency:** LPs can create precise liquidity shapes and strategies
- **Flexible Strategies:** Supports spot, curve, and bid-ask liquidity distributions

### Technical Innovation Opportunities
1. **Bin-based Limit Orders:** Use inactive bins to create limit orders
2. **Automated Rebalancing:** Adjust liquidity distribution based on price movements
3. **Impermanent Loss Mitigation:** Strategic bin placement to minimize IL
4. **Fee Optimization:** Dynamic strategies based on volatility patterns
