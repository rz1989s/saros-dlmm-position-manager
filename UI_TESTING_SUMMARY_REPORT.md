## Key Achievements & Fixes

### üîß Critical Issues Resolved

1. **React Hydration Errors (#418, #423)** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Root cause: SSR/client-side state mismatch in DataSourceProvider
   - Solution: Added proper client-side checks and loading states
   - Impact: Eliminated console errors and improved user experience

2. **Mock Data Loading Issue** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Root cause: Polling disabled without wallet connection
   - Solution: Modified useUserPositions hook to enable polling in mock mode
   - Impact: 0 positions now displays proper mock data

3. **Analytics Tab Content Switching** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Root cause: Race condition with lazy loading
   - Solution: Robust render logic checking `isRealDataMode` instead of `!isMockDataMode`
   - Impact: Tabs now switch content correctly

4. **RPC 401/403 Console Errors** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Solution: Enhanced error handling with appropriate logging levels
   - Impact: Clean console experience in demo mode

5. **Build Verification** ‚úÖ VERIFIED
   - All pages (/, /analytics, /strategies) build without 500 errors
   - Static generation works correctly
